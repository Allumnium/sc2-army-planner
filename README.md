## Features

- **Dual panels**: Team 1 vs Team 2 for quick “what if” comparisons.
- **Income bars with overspend**: Minerals/Gas bars show income vs planned spend; red indicates overspend.
- **Units table**: Add any unit, set “constant production” streams, see minerals/min & gas/min.
- **Army summary and detailed analysis**
- **Qualities**: Tankiness, Damage, Utility, Micro Requirement, Easily Countered, Cost.
- **Counters & bonus profile**: Common counters vs your comp; where your DPS is focused (vs Light/Armored/Air/etc.).
- **Parameters**: Worker rates, gas weights, geysers/base, MULE math, micro efficiency, and more.
- **Sharable state**: Build is encoded in the URL hash—use **“Share Army URL”**.

## Roadmap / Ideas

- save/load named presets to localStorage
- condense the url save data and make the build name part of the URL
- review or remove 'counterability' bars
- add "recommended buildings" section in unit production (aka, 3x Barracks + reactor, 3 Hatcheries + injector queens)
