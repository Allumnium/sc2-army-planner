## Features

* **Dual panels**: Team 1 vs Team 2 for quick “what if” comparisons.
* **Income bars with overspend**: Minerals/Gas bars show income vs planned spend; red indicates overspend.
* **Units table**: Add any unit, set “constant production” streams, see minerals/min & gas/min.
* **Army summary and detailed analysis**
* **Qualities**: Tankiness, Damage, Utility, Micro Requirement, Easily Countered, Cost.
* **Counters & bonus profile**: Common counters vs your comp; where your DPS is focused (vs Light/Armored/Air/etc.).
* **Upgrades**: Weapons/Armor (0–3) and key tech toggles (Stim, Charge, Adrenal, etc.).
* **Parameters**: Worker rates, gas weights, geysers/base, MULE math, micro efficiency, and more.
* **Sharable state**: Build is encoded in the URL hash—use **“Share Army URL”**.
